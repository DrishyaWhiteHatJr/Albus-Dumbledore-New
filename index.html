        <p>Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was so much more than just the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was just like a grandfather to Harry and guided all of us throught some of the darkest times in the Wizarding World. He was a kind, powerful, mysterious and wise person. He never hesitated to sacrifise for all his students and even strangers.</p>

        <h1>Favorite Moments</h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>One of my favorite moments in the series was at the beginning first few reactions. When Harry wasn't very familiar with Dumbledore, and believed he was a sort of mad man.
            When Dumbledore gave remarks about Bertie Botts Every Flavored Beans, I couldn't help but laughing. He never thought twice before sacrifising his life and his life's works for Harry and his students. All though everyone believed he was naive and trusted people way too easily. He is the wisest person, and the only one who doubted Tom Riddle; later Lord Voldermort.
